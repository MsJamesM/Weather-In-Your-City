# Weather-In-Your-City

## Description

This simple weather application collects the user's city input and returns the city's current and future weather information using OpenWeatherMap's free <i>Current Weather Data</i> and <i>5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast</i> API's. The application was created for Denver University's Coding Boot Camp as part of a challenge assignment due 6/8. To satisfy criteria, the application provides search functionality that returns the name of the city the user entered, the current date, and current and forecasted weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, with corresponding weather icons. Additionally, the app provides basic local storage, which allows the user to select and view previous searches.
